# prompt-bot
slack bot to manage prompts with organizational efficiency

# Solution

I'd like to use ChatGPT internally to promote prompt engineering. But I don't know how to **manage company-wide** prompts...
With the current mix of remote workers and those who come to work, the **Chat tool should be utilized as a hub of communication**.
I tried to code such a thought!

# Feature

- You can register a prompt in Slack and a sample of its output.(Samples are available for both images and text.)
