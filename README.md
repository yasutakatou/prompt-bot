# prompt-bot
 **slack bot to manage prompts with organizational efficiency**

# Solution

I'd like to use ChatGPT internally to promote prompt engineering. But I don't know how to **manage company-wide** prompts...<br>
With the current mix of remote workers and those who come to work, the **Chat tool should be utilized as a hub of communication**.<br>
And because it's a Slack bot, it can be used from a smartphone!<br>
I tried to code such a thought!<br>

# Feature

The following operations can be performed on Slack by specifying a word!

- You can register a prompt in Slack and a sample of its output. (Samples are available for both **images and text**.)<br>
- You can search for registered prompts in natural language. (The search algorithm is **ngram**.)<br>

# installation

If you want to put it under the path, you can use the following.

```
go get github.com/yasutakatou/prompt-bot
```

If you want to create a binary and copy it yourself, use the following.

```
git clone https://github.com/yasutakatou/prompt-bot
cd prompt-bot
go build .
```

or download binary from release page. save binary file, copy to entryed execute path directory.

# uninstall

delete that binary. del or rm command. (it's simple!)

# set up

Please follow the steps below to set up your environment.

1. set tool like bot.

# usecase

There are three major uses<br>
1) Register prompts and output results in **text**.<br>
2) Register prompts as **text and output results as images**.<br>
3) **Search** prompts with natural language processing.<br>
<br>
note) Deletion is not supported. Because we haven't come up with an easy-to-understand deletion method.<br>
<br>
In other words, prompt sharing can be achieved on a company-wide basis by applying this bot across the board!<br>
<br>
note) It would be interesting to visualize the use of AI by aggregating the most used prompts or most searched people from the usage history logs.ã€€You should honor its users.<br>

## When registering by text

The prompt and output results are arranged in text, bounded by the words specified in the **options record and result**.

![1](https://github.com/yasutakatou/prompt-bot/assets/22161385/712c0bca-47b9-4dee-8d9d-011ad427198e)

The bot will suggest the top-ranking prompts from ngram search results.

## To register the results as an image

**Attached is an image** of the resulting output along with a word for prompt registration.

Here, too, the bot suggests top prompts from ambiguous search results.

## search

Four search methods are available.<br>

- **ambiguous search(n-gram)**
- **Ambiguous search that returns multiple results(n-gram)**
- **Static word search**
- **Static word search returning multiple outputs**

**Specify the word you want to search for by inserting a space between the command words for the search as shown below.**

![image](https://github.com/yasutakatou/prompt-bot/assets/22161385/27a7e49f-b3bc-40f9-98be-12a671864917)

note) The command word for the search can be changed by the startup options.<br>
note) The number of instructions for multiple outputs can also be changed by the startup options.<br>

## Output usage reports

There is the ability to periodically go back through the messages and **tally the reactions to the prompts**.

This would also stimulate organizational use by recognizing those who have posted the best prompts based on the number of reactions they have received, or those who have added the most reactions (i.e., those who are making the most use of the prompts)!
