# prompt-bot
 **slack bot to manage prompts with organizational efficiency**

# Solution

I'd like to use ChatGPT internally to promote prompt engineering. But I don't know how to **manage company-wide** prompts...<br>
With the current mix of remote workers and those who come to work, the **Chat tool should be utilized as a hub of communication**.<br>
And because it's a Slack bot, it can be used from a smartphone!<br>
I tried to code such a thought!<br>

# Feature

The following operations can be performed on Slack by specifying a word!

- You can register a prompt in Slack and a sample of its output. (Samples are available for both **images and text**.)<br>
- You can search for registered prompts in natural language. (The search algorithm is **ngram**.)<br>

# installation

If you want to put it under the path, you can use the following.

```
go get github.com/yasutakatou/prompt-bot
```

If you want to create a binary and copy it yourself, use the following.

```
git clone https://github.com/yasutakatou/prompt-bot
cd prompt-bot
go build .
```

or download binary from release page. save binary file, copy to entryed execute path directory.

# uninstall

delete that binary. del or rm command. (it's simple!)

# set up

Please follow the steps below to set up your environment.

1. set tool like bot.

# usecase

There are three major uses<br>
1) Register prompts and output results in **text**.<br>
2) Register prompts as **text and output results as images**.<br>
3) **Search** prompts with natural language processing.<br>
<br>
note) Deletion is not supported. Because we haven't come up with an easy-to-understand deletion method.<br>
<br>
In other words, prompt sharing can be achieved on a company-wide basis by applying this bot across the board!<br>
<br>
note) It would be interesting to visualize the use of AI by aggregating the **most used prompts or most searched people from the usage history logs**.ã€€You should honor its users.<br>

## When registering by text

The prompt and output results are arranged in text, bounded by the words specified in the **options record and result**.

The bot will suggest the top-ranking prompts from ngram search results.

## To register the results as an image

**Attached is an image** of the resulting output along with a word for prompt registration.

Here, too, the bot suggests top prompts from ambiguous search results.
